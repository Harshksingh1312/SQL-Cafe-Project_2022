# ☕ SQL Cafe Project

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a café’s **customer transactions, menu, and loyalty program** using SQL.  
It demonstrates how to design a database, insert sample data, and run queries to analyze **sales performance, customer behavior, and loyalty program impact**.

## 🗄️ Database Structure
- **transactions** → customer purchases (customer_id, transaction_date, product_id)  
- **menu** → product details (product_id, product_name, price)  
- **loyalty_members** → loyalty program join dates  

## 🔑 Key Analyses
- Total spending by each customer  
- Number of visits and first purchases  
- Most purchased items & top-spending customers  
- Loyalty program effect (before & after joining)  
- Reward points system with bonus logic  
- Daily sales trends & revenue by product  
- Customers who purchased all menu items  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- SQL database creation & schema design  
- Writing **joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and CASE statements**  
- Using SQL for **business insights & customer analytics**
